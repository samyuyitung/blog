I'm told I should try to write. Here is my attempt

## Credit

Based on the [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme, built by 
Barry Clark.

I just flattened it so I could keep a cleaner git history

## Local development

All new posts are made in the [_posts](_posts) folder with the syntax

`<date in iso>-<title>.md`

To run locally

```shell
# Install required gem
gem install github-pages

# start local server
jekyll serve
```
