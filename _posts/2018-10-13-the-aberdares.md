A couple of weeks ago, my roommates and I went camping a couple hours north of
Nairobi in the [Aberdare mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdare_Range). There is a national park there, but we had
stayed outside the park in a valley. This valley was littered with tea and
coffee farms and was quite green due to the stream at the base of the valley.

The drive up there was a nightmare as we had relied on Google maps to route us
which took us on the back roads to get there. The car that we were in was a
Toyota Noah which had 7 peoples worth of gear (and beer) in it which caused it
to ride really low. In addition the car had very slick tires so in combination
this car struggled to go up the steep dirt hills that we were one. At points we
had to hop out of the car so it could get up the hill or push it if it needed
even more motivation.

Eventually we got th the place that we were staying at, which was a quaint
[cottages place](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aberdare+Cottages+and+Fishing+Lodge/@-0.6252703,36.8762807,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x1828eddaa97bbf17:0xc413f3c0989ac80d!5m1!1s2018-11-17!8m2!3d-0.6252757!4d36.8784747) which was quite muzungu friendly and was confirmed later as some
UN cars were also there for the weekend. We did have the campground to ourselves
and were able to have a nice fire at night under the semi visible stars. However
it did rain on us slightly in the evening and overnight.

The main attraction at this place was the river at the bottom which I went to
both days we were there. The first time, we just went down and checked it out.
To get down there we would pass through someones tea farm and there was a nice
veranda and fishing shack at the bottom. From here we walked up the bank to see
more of the river. The second time we went there, we swam in the river which was
frigid, but with the hot sun -- it was quite refreshing.

###### The creek

We had spoken to some of the people at the cottages, and they said that they
stocked the river with trouts for fly/spincast fishing. Two of the other that we
were camping with had gone fishing the first morning but were unable to catch
anything. But apparently it's normally quite plentiful especially for fly
fishing.

This part of Kenya is known for its tea and coffee farming and on our way in it
seemed like it was the the only crop grown (+ corn for themselves). Almost all
of the tea from this region is exported, but apparently it is some high quality
black tea that they are growing here. This was my first time seeing tea grown
and the part that I like the most is how even the bushes are.

###### Tea plants

All and all this was a nice relaxing diesel free weekend away from Nairobi
(except for the drive up).
