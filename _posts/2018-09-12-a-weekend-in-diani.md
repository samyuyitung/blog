title: A weekend in Diani
tags: [Kenya, Travel]
subtitle: Sept 6 - 9, 2018

My job can pretty much be done anywhere with an internet connection. In the past
the company has worked with many remote developers but has maintained a stable
homebase in Nairobi.  much of the team is already remote and our manager (the
only other person that works out of Nairobi) was still in Canada

So Hyunjin (the other intern) and I packed up our bags and headed out to the
coast for the weekend to sunny [Diani Beach]() on the southern coast of Kenya.
As a couple of broke bois, we decided to take the cheap way to here, by

1. taking the train from Nairobi to Mombasa
2. Spending a night in Mombasa
3. Taking a tuk tuk from Mombasa to the ferry.
4. Taking the ferry across the Likoni strait
5. then taking a Matatu from Mombasa to Diani.

In total this took ~7hrs of travel time compared to the 1hr for a flight to the
airport directly to Diani, since we have the time its worth it but for just a
weekend trip, I would pay the extra money and fly so that you could get the
extra time down here.

Seeing as we were technically "working" we had to set aside some time on our
first day here to do some work. So we decided we would explore the beach near
our AirBnB on our first day. Our place is on the northrn part of the beach,
which is much narrower and dirtier than the southern end. This day we just
walked along the beach which was covered in seaweeds and opened coconuts. Which
on one hand wasn't that nice, but on the bright side, there were no people
trying to sell us ebony keychains.

On our second day, in the morning we headed over to the main part of the beach
near the BaoBob hotel. We had heard that this part of the beach was nicer
because it is taken care of by these hotels, and also the bougie hotels would be
set up at the nicer parts. Without a plan, we just decided to take a tuk tuk up
there and go with the flow. Our only idea was to got to [Shashin-ka]() a
Japanese restaurant for dinner

Diani is known for it's water sports ranging from kitesurfing, kayaking, stand
up paddleboard, dhow ship snorkelling and scuba, deep sea fishing, etc. But as a
couple of broke boys, we decided to sneak into the baobab hotel and swim on
their private beach and pools for the day. This hotel was massive with at least
4 pools and their own private beach. When we showed up, it was reaching high
tide so the waves out on the beach were massive, (not surf-able) but definitly
bo Compared to Kilifi I felt like this water was much refreshing.  After
body-surfing for a bit, we rented some boogie boards for an hour to play in the
water with while the waves were still large. I would compare the waves to those
in Cape Cod/Maine. Definitely not surfable but fun for pretty much anything
else.

###### Baobab Beach club

We had plans to go to a sushi place for dinner that was approximetly 2 miles
away down the beach. We ended up walking this distance along the beach passing
by a few camel riders, beach dogs and a lot of sand crabs. Compared to Nyali,
this beach was much nicer in terms of the beach but also with the lack of curio
shops and keychain sellers dalong the beach.

The rule of thumb in Kenya for white people is to not be walking outside after
dark. But during the day you are fine Since we walked to the sushi place, we
arrived before the sunset and before dinner officially started. We had ordered
omakaze, which doesn't really make sense until the chef arrived. This restaurant
was owned by a Korean man who learned how to make sushi from one of the top
sushi masters in Korea, but apparently this restaurant was only his side hustle.
This was probably one of the best sushi restaurants I've been too due to the
freshness of the fish. Everything we ate was freshly caught that day except for
the salmon (which comes from Norway). But you can definitely taste the freshness
of the shrimp, octopus and snapper that were served.

Other than that the rest of the trip was mainly the daylong travel home. There
was a pitstop in Mombasa for Indian food (A great Briyani I might add), and then
a train ride home. On the ride home, we again passed through Tsavo National Park
where we saw zebras, elephants, antelopes, warthogs, wildebeasts, and giraffes.
