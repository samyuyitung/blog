On Sunday, we went to a free soccer game between Kenya and Ethiopia. The game
was a qualifying match for the Africa Cup of Nations and was the second leg of a
head to head after a 0-0 draw in Ethiopia on Wednesday.

## The ticket getting

The tickets were free, and were being given out on a first come first serve
basis starting at 9am. The game started at 4pm and Hyunjin and I went there for
8am to line up and get our tickets. In the end we were the 7th and 8th people in
the line which we though would have given us the advertised VIP tickets. That
morning was rough as we had gotten home the night before at 5:30am. So we were
waiting in line for an hour, hungover, sleep deprived, under the sun, all the
while being heckled by the other people in line as we were the only Muzungus
there. 

But eventually we got the tickets which to no suprise were __not__ VIP
tickets, oh well. Once we got our tickets, we entered the stadium to see
what it was like. It was a respectable size and according to wikipedia seats
60,000 people. There were three levels of seats with stools at the base level,
proper chairs on the second level and benches at the top level. 

Naively we though that they won't give out more tickets than seats, and that
there should be no issue with coming back later because of course we had our
tickets. So we went home for the afternoon to go and sleep.

## The getting in

We had taken an uber to get there from our house and once we got close to the
stadium, we saw some tear gas go off next to the highway and hundreds of people
run across the road away from the gas. This was the first point that we thought
that we wouldn't get into the game. As we continued to get closer to the stadium
the amount of police/military increased. Along the ride we saw poeple trying to
hop the fence to get into the stadium and a military jeep racing towards them,
not sure if they got in but that doesn't seem like a very fun position to be in.

As we got closer to the gate, there was another stretch of "warzone" where there
were people taking motorcycles to try and get past the cops. This resulted in us
driving through tear gas (thank god for windows) to get to the gate. Once we had
got to the gate our driver dropped us off and then drove away as quick as he
could. Wouldn't blame him, but we were dropped at the VIP gate as the president
of Kenya's motorcade was driving by so the gates were opened for him.

Also at this gate there were were probably 50 other people trying to get into
the game who were there prior to us getting dropped off, but the guards
wouldn't open the gate. But, once the presidential motorcade went through, as
they were trying to close the gate these people forced it back open and we ran
through as fast as we could. Side note: I fully expected to be tear gassed at
this point, but when in Kenya....

Eventually we got passed the remaining gates and actually got into the stadium.

Once we got in, our hopes of actually finding a seat diminished extremely. I
thought that if there was anywhere that we could get a seat it would be in the
nosebleeds, but as we did a lap of the stadium, every entrance was completely
blocked with people and there were people even standing on the handrails to try
and get a glimpse of the game. As our hopes decreased we got lucky and found a
section on the base level that we could sit in the aisle to see. These stairs
were probably less crowded since they were in the sun but hey, at this point we
just wanted to watch the game.

## The game

The game itself was a lot of fun and had a final score of 3-0 Kenya so the
spirits were high in the stadium. It was funny as everytime Kenya got the ball
everyone would stand up. And these teams were not that good so possesion changed
quite often. 

Since the game was free, the crowd at the game was probably quite a bit
different from a normal game and was quite rowdy. That combined with the fact
that the crowd was almost entirely all Kenya fans it made for a great
experience. We shouted some Swahili chants that I had no clue what I was saying,
and would get excited with the Kenya dudes around us when something good
happened.

## Thoughts

Although the quality of soccer itself was quite lackluster. This was probably
one of my top highlights so far in Kenya. The atmosphere before, during and
after the game made me feel the most Kenyan I've felt so far, hanging out with
the people of Nairobi over a common enjoyment of soccer.

10 / 10 would definitely go again. I don't think there will be any other free
soccer games again but I should definitely look into if there are any
basketball or rugby games that I can go to
