tags: [Kenya, Travel]

Before I actually start working in Nairobi, I flew out a week early to travel
here in the country. In the end I spent 1 week on the coast of Kenya in two
different cities, Mombasa and Kilifi

### Saturday - Nyali

I started my travels in Nyali, a beach town just north of Mombasa where I stayed
at Tuliahouse backpackers. My first day here I arrived in the evening and went
to the beach for a quick swim. Surprisingly the water is not that warm (lake
like) but sure is refreshing compared to the hot and humid heat of the city.

### Sunday - Old town Mombasa

The next day, with Angie (a fellow backpacker) we took a matatu into the big
city to check out old town Mombasa. Mombasa originally was a port city founded
by the Portuguese in the 1500s which they used to control the ivory, spices gold
and slavery.

During the day, we went to [Fort Jesus](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1295),
which was built in 1563 by the Portuguese. The fort was designed by an Italian
architect and resembles a human body from above. There is a long and rich
history about this fort, as it was taken over by the Omani in late 1600s, and
then taken over again by the British again in the late 1800s. The fort takes on
architectural aspects from both Europe and the Omani, with many of the rooms
having Omani doors. A cool tidbit about the place is that when the Omani took
over the fort, they feared that the Portuguese poisoned the existing water well
in the fort. So, the Omani dug their own well right next to the existing one and
used it instead.

###### Fort Jesus

After the fort, we went to the Mombasa tusk gate that was built in the 1960s to
commemorate Princess Margaret's visit to Mombasa. According to our tour guide
Jeff

> The tusks form an 'M' for Mombasa and upside down, they form a 'W' for
> welcome.
Thus these tusks mean "Welcome to Mombasa"

Across from the tusks is Uhuru gardens which has many fruit trees (Mangos,
coconuts). Because of this there are many fruit bats that hang out in the park
all day.

Also the beach near the backpackers was pretty cool. Lots of guys trying to sell
me ebony keychains, but nice nonetheless

###### Mombasa Beach during the day

## Monday - Kilifi

Early on Monday, I headed up to Kilifi a beach town that is an hour north of
Mombasa. To get up there, I took a Matatu. Matatus are privately run minibuses
that locals used to travel due to a lack of public transportation. These buses
are often overcrowded, spew diesel, and blare loud music, but at the same time
they are cheap. Rather than a $40 taxi ride, I got up there for $2.

[Kilifi town](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kilifi+Stage+Bus+Stop/@-3.6321959,39.8125462,13.8z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x183fdd0b09499467:0xf32195f25a65f294!2sKilifi!3b1!8m2!3d-3.5106508!4d39.9093269!3m4!1s0x183fdd7df61a2f8f:0x7d9ee686cf9bb414!8m2!3d-3.6330198!4d39.8519424)
is a fishing village and beach resorot that is along the coast and is home to the 
the largest creek (bay) along the Kenyan coast. Within this creek, there is an
abundance of green coconuts, cashews and snapper fish. I had a chance to try all
three of these when I was here.

On Monday, I checked out Mazingira Park which is a beach in the creek and walked
around the market. Within the market, there were many stalls selling
clothes/bags. (Gucci slides for $8) but I ended up only buying some oranges,
bananas and fried potatoes. A mighty fine dinner if you ask me.

## Tuesday - Kilifi

It turns out that Tuesday was the start of Eid Al-Fitr a prominent Muslim
holiday. This meant that pretty much all the stores and schools were closed. In
the morning I took a boda boda out to the main beach in Kilifi, Bofa Beach.

Originally my plan was to walk up and down the beach, and find a place to chill
for the day.  Instead, I met a local fisherman named Galu that ended up being my
"tour guide" for the day. Together, he showed me around a few villages and then
ended up at his place for a lunch time feast for the holiday with his family.
For lunch we had some ugali (mashed maize) chicken and greens, which was quite
delicious. Although English is an official language in Kenya, Galu and his
sister were the only ones that could speak English that they learned in school.
Quite awkward for lunch time conversation as I only know my manners in Swahili.

After lunch Galu showed me his stash of fish and some massive octopuses that he
had caught that morning and then we went back to the beach for a swim. Since it
was a holiday the beach was packed with people swimming, playing soccer and just
hanging out. Unlike North America, there is not a concept of beach lounging with
chairs and blankets so there was a lot of room for activities along the beach.
Unlike the Mombasa beach in Nyali, there weren't any people trying to sell
keychains so as a Mzungu it was a little more peaceful

## Wednesday - Kilifi

This day, I headed out to the backpackers and ecolodge that in Kilifi called
distant relatives.  On their private beach I (again) met a couple of local
fisherman that showed me around their village. This one was located more inland
that Galu's and relied more on coconuts and cashews for trade. With them I had
some fresh coconuts, cashews and palm wine.

![Coconuts](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RM-ICNa0IxBMgkOSQBCxZtcW9Y_jUxkxZvXlutcZj3MYK0rMv3fmVeFWjgPReUUNBKgmVz6_c9zOjvibqPnNKjp7_hxa6gbNzox6DktTn3BW64UtXf2HJzY6q9OETRbt5lZHqoDUWmkj2Bw5hz5Js2WKj7Hb1yra7dysUODcgzGItcKn4EWe85ML39EzPZrQaYrcqb18qHp16tD3gKWVrvrQwz__txyw60qBwY0EMbuFM4WkXpGqDMI5MMQ7BrpBwkQf4hTm7RGRASIVd12sb0l9GOMr-5It1h92cNiuRD_HwW2T5vuLkbQxBggeG7XDGQvjG5UaP-bzHb5c2QDHlPCObR_KUKllxCvzW3Dt8FWUwK_D_SuzqG5_gEocEnpwg8pj9ZQFextvppGJk5lK5gCpekmKbztJ-ZXMhj_tAnfj0mxrpduEyAcEjNhS8tq7YjYrA1Y5STEHzxrQFc03YAxVLy-a2ntvPquj0PzajqSsV-cHIQSOdvT4IL-CXSz4E1emeB6nCsrmfpFQVy3CrTmpbQmu17GTYQAkraNHeKSvVXP-n5mV8wMHbo-yrcHVTRUyPOzmZxJR0IQdSlhNZ5McY5hVq4lwXS7ZmuwGfTh8RbXQnyd4YLH0RosAT2OArp80x9copWeEqP2asL1UpEAnhf5ZlS1n4YWaTwM8KCMxyzGYCmxgEwdB=w500-h330-no) 
###### Climbing trees with Seth

Afterwards I headed across the bridge to Mnarani and hung out at the beach for a
little bit.  This beach had a lot off fishing boats docked for the day. During
the daytime the fisherman aren't out, so their boats were docked on the beach.
They used some pretty cool traditional boats. Once again since it was holiday
the beach was packed.

## Thursday - Nyali

On Thursday, I headed back to Nyali in a Matatu (no music... Sad!) in the
morning. In the afternoon I went to [Haller
park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haller_Park) which was just a short walk
away from my hostel. This park - formerly a quarry - has thrived into a rich
ecosystem that was developed by Rene Haller in the 1970s. Within this park there
is an abundance of wildlife in a zoo like fashion including

* Hippos, antelopes and water buffaloes
* Crocodiles
* Giraffes
* Tortoises
* Reptile emporium
* Butterfly conservatory
* Fish farm

Also there is an abundance of vervet monkeys that just hang out around the park

I had stuck around for the feeding of the animals and I was able to feed the
giraffes. Afterwards I watched the feeding of the Antelopes and Hippos, and the
crocodiles. The crocodiles live off 1 proper meal a week, but there is a daily
"show" to keep them active where they climb out of the water to fetch some fresh
chicken.

## Friday - Nairobi

I had to head home on Friday and was able to get a seat on the train. Previously
a 10 hour plus journey was able to be done in half the time on this train. Along
the journey, we passed through Tsavo national park where I saw a bunch of
elephants, some ostriches and some antelopes out the window of the train. In the
end,  besides being in a train car with a bunch of summer camp kid, it was a
10/10 experience, would train again.

## Final thoughts

As a first trip (and solo) in Kenya this was a great trip. I'm definitely going
to head back some time soon. There were a few things that I missed out on
(scuba/snorkelling/boating) but I can always save them for next time

A photo album of this trip is available
