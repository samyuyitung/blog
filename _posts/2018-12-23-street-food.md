## Lunches

I have spent the past 17(!) weeks in Kenya and I can honestly say that for more
than 90% of the days I've spent here I have eaten street food for lunch. In the
past I have always been the type of person to eat a packed lunch due to the
price compared to buying it everyday. However in Kenya, the contrary is true and
when I eat street food it is less than if I was to prepare a proper lunch. Thus,
I ate street food every day.

In Nairobi and Kisumu, there are "hotels" everywhere that serve food as well as
street side stalls. Due to obvious health reasons, I tried my best to not eat
meat at these places and would go for vegetarian options whenever possible.
Kenyan lunches are broken down into 3 main parts, the starch, the vegetable and
the main dish

The starches consisted of

- Ugali
- Chapati
- Andazi
- Rice

The vegetables consisted of 

- Sukuma wiki (kale)
- Boiled cabbage

And the main dishes were

- Beans
- Ndengu (Lentils)
- Irio (Peas)
- Githiri (Beans and corn)

I would try to mix it up every once and a while, but in general the majority of
the dishes I ate was Ugali + Sukuma Wiki + Beans with beef soup broth. Depending
on where you got this this ranged from 30KSh to 100KSh, but regardless of where
you went this was pretty reliable.

Our regular spot was close to our apartment and this meal cost 50KSh there. This
place had exceptional soup and an amazing pili pili (chilis, tomatoes and
onions. Towards the end we were going there everyday and this led to us being
able to order "the usual". Also as a bonus, I never got sick (like physically
ill) from this place so A+ to them for that

## Snacks

Other than lunches I would often also pick up things on the street. Some other
common snacks I would get were

- Chapatis (20 KSh per)
- Andazi (10 KSh per, but 5 in Kisumu)
- Grilled corn on the cob (20 KSh)
- Peanuts (10 KSh)
- Bananas, Mangos, Pineapple, Watermelon (10 - 50 KSh
- Popsicles (30 KSh)

Typically I would get a Banana and peanuts when I was working in Nairobi, in
Kisumu I was all about the andazis due to their value at 5 KSh per.

## Vegetable markets.

Also on the weekends I would go to the 

PS. I did buy some albendezole so I should be fine worm wise.
