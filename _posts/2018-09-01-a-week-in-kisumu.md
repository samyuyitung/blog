I spent my first week in
[Kisumu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kisumu/@-0.0558437,34.6401918,11.15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x182aa437ad4ac81d:0x2012a439d6248dd2!8m2!3d-0.0917016!4d34.7679568),
a town on the eastern side of Kenya. The operations team and the only other
developer in Kenya were stationed out there so rather than being alone in
Nairobi, I worked out of there.

The "office" itself is located in Milimani, the original British neighbourhood,
which is near the downtown and the lake.

On Monday when I arrived, we went to 
[Dunga Hill Camp](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dunga+Hill+Camp/@-0.137012,34.736221,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x182abb22f2ddac67:0x89c8e333f6f27cc4!8m2!3d-0.137012!4d34.738415)
a restaurant on the coast of Lake Victoria.  In Kenya, dinner is eaten around
7pm which was perfect for us to view the sunset before we ate.  Apparently, this
part of the shore is home to hippos and crocodiles which are both agressive
towards humans. Luckily there were none around at sunset so we could view it
"safely".

The hippos are typically only active when the sun isn't out so the best time to
see them are in the morning or evening. Otherwise they just sit in the grass out
of the sun. On our bodaboda ride home we saw 3 hippos along the way home next to
the lake.

On Tuesday, I went on a field trip with the company up to the
[Bungoma](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.2918753,36.7785816,15z) county to
check out some of the health centers and dispenseries that we would be
supporting in the future. With the health director for the county, we ended up
touring two health centers and a dispensery. Dispenseries are the lowest level
of public health available and are small centers that are staffed by a single
nurse. A health center is the level directly above dispenseries that offer
additional services such as CCCs and paternity care. Maisha Meds has been
selected to be used in these facilities to manage the pharmacies, so it was
educational to get some context as to how this app would be used.

That night for dinner, Martin and I went to
[wayside](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wayside+Bar+%26+Restaurant/@-0.072961,34.6604215,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x182aaf3f4ccda135:0x727a72b06c8113fe!8m2!3d-0.072961!4d34.6626155),
a collection of bars and chicken grills along a street. For dinner we had a
whole grilled chicken and
[kachumbari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachumbari), which is a cold salad of
tomatoes and onions.

The rest of my week in Kisumu were pretty uneventful with my days consisting of
working. For lunches we would go to the hotel next door and enjoy a typical
Kenyan meal of rice/chapati with beans/chicken stew/beef stew. Ranging from
$1-2. For dinners, we had Indian food one night. All the factories are owned by
Indian people so the indian food around here is ðŸ”¥. Additionally I discovered
the greatness that is a [Stoney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoney_(drink))
which is a Kenyan version of ginger ale which is extremely gingery. Alongside
passionfruit fantas and strawberry mirindas, these will be come my drink of
choice out here in Kenya.

To get around in Kisumu we would take bodabodas which are private motorcycle
taxis to get pretty much anywhere in the city, you can pay 200Ksh ($2 USD).
Kisumu is a slightly quieter city so I felt pretty safe riding on these things
but in Nairobi, they scare the life out of me. But to quote my hero Dominic
Toretto

> Ride or die.
